This file specifies version compatibility constraint between inter-dependent
components within the system.

The supported component types are:
 1. VMware vCenter Server
 2. VMware ESXi
 3. VxRail Manager
 4. VxRail VIB

Tag description for each <component>:

<type>                      - needs to be one of the component type value listed above.
<supportedVersionInfo>      - supported version for this component and only one tag per <component>.
    <version>               - Actual version string (inclusive) - for VC and ESXi, it is AboutInfo.version;
    <minBuild>              - Optional field: minimum build number(inclusive). This field will be used to
                              determine if two versions match only if version string matches first.
<nonSupported>              - non supported version for this component and only one tag per <component>.
<dependentComponent>        - one or more dependent components of this component and can be multiple
                              tags per <component>.
<compatibleVersionInfo>     - one or more versions (inclusive) of each dependent component that are compatible
                              with the supported version specified in <supportedVersionInfo>.

For VMware products, refer to: KB article 1014508 for the mapping between build number and releases.
Minimum build number is used to differentiate update releases among a same version.
